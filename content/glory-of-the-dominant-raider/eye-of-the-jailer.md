## Details

Do the fight as normal, bringing the eye down to 33 percent to start phase 3, during the earlier phases, make sure to keep the center of the room clear.

After the boss casts Immediate Extermination, click on the satchel in the back of the room, this contains the Scavenged S.E.L.F.I.E. Camera (note this cannot be clicked before phase 3).

Take a selfie and get everyone in the raid and the boss the Photoflash! debuff.

If you move closer to the eye makes it easier to get the boss the photoflash! debuff. (this can be a pain to do, I recommend practicing beforehand with a normal selfie camera)

Finish the fight as normal.

In order to take a picture of the boss you have to move a bit closer to it when you snap the picture.
You can still move while holding the camera
