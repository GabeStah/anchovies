## Details

> You can't get  Flawless Fate If you died from the boss melee hit at the start and stay dead through the whole fight, I tested this for science.

This is an individual achievement.

All you got to do is avoid taking damage from:

- Fated Conjunction (the giant black lines)
- Call of Eternity (the bomb)
- Echo of Eternity (bomb echo-please note is not a mechanic on Normal)
- Fate Fragment (the grey and black orbs during the rune phase)

Please note the achievement tracker may not turn red if you've taken damage.

Thank the gods this is an personal achievement...

My tips for achieving this on normal:

1. Mobile classes shine here, but lacking that go get you speedy talents, gear, covenant abilities and conduits: It all helps. Soulshape blink is super useful extra mobility CD for anyone, and Door of Shadows isn't bad either.
2. You need to use your eyes, DBM can't save you from yourself nor from your fellow raiders.
3. Said raiders can easily mess up your progress by not carrying the bombs far enough from the group, you have to be ready to move yourself out of the range if required.
4. Be ready to look out at the whole room before the beams start powering up to have the maximum time to move around. You don't have the time to second guess your escape direction. Use mobility CD's whenever you are unsure of clearing the blast zones in time (every now and then you'll pick a bad direction, it happens).
5. Sometimes you get the bombs and the beams at the same time. Use a strong mobility CD if you are carrying a bomb and dodging an incoming beam at the same time (running to the edges of the room usually works).
6. Be careful when the intermission starts: The orb spawn points might appear right under you on the outer edges of the room and they aren't visually super obvious. If you can, run against the push coming from the boss until you identify the closest spawn point - then it's just about remembering to dodge those puddles when they slowly rotate along the outer edge.
7. If you are assigned to run the rings during intermissions, don't ask for the smallest ones. It's easier to dodge the orbs when you are on the medium or larger sized rings. This is ofc up to your personal preference and what you find the easiest work with. The smallest ones aren't a mission impossible.
8. It's bad news if you get assigned to run the rings at the 3rd phase (the rings are turning now at random times). If you can, get out of phase 3 duty: There is a moment when beams WILL come when there also are rings to rotate: You'll usually be in the blast zone if you stay on your rune, but if you run away from your rune you might cause a wipe (the timer is shorter in this phase).

And the last thing, don't f up your own raid group when hunting for this. It's quite doable if tanking is done in sensible places and if you remember to keep your own eyes open.
