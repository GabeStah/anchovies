## Details

Whack-A-Soul requires alot of DPS and interupts. Before the encounter begins on the left pillar when you enter Painsmith Raznal room you will see a lever you click to Raise Gibbets.

When combat beings caged Burning Gibbet will rise from the fire. You have to balance damaging boss and killing the Burning Gibbet so they do not get out of control. If left ignored more will spawn. This is important because they each cast Terrifying Shriek fearing all players for 4 seconds.

This achievement will become substantially easier with gear.

After going down the stairs, but before going to the platform, click the lever on the left to activate the burning gibbets.

During the fight caged Burning Gibbets containing Burning Soul will elevate during the fight and cast Terrifying Shriek.

You will need to kill all the burning souls as well as interrupt the Terrifying Shriek if it is close to going off (it will fear everyone if it goes off).

Failure to keep up with the burning souls will cause the raid to become overwhelmed so a lot of DPS is needed right now. This achievement will get easier with more loot.
