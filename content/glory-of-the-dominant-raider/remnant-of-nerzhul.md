## Details

This was updated recently, not sure when. There is now a moving ring ontop of the previous which you need to time throwing the orbs through both.

I Used to Bullseye Deeprun Rats Back Home is a very tedious achievement. Before pulling look around the outside of the platform for a round circular quidditch goal hanging from the ceiling. (I hope the reference helps)

To get this achievement you must pick up an Orb of Torment, travel to the edge of the platform directly in front of the goal referenced, use your extra action button to toss the Orb of Torment perfectly through the whole.

Do not be fooled by the visual. If you successfully tossed it, an emote will appear in chat "a goal has been scored". Once you've made three sucsessful goals, you can kill the boss.

We got the achievement in our sec. pull. The sec goal (I will name it pendolum) was there before, but not visible. You have to kick the balls through both, and as it is already stated a chat emote will appear.
The nearly best time to kick the ball is as soon as the pendulum reach the peak on the left or the right side.
