## Details

This is not a personal achievement

The whole raid need the debuff and have to dodge the final hit from Torment so the "drain" dmg before the hit will not fail the achievement

---

Before the fight target Garrosh Hellscream and type /taunt.

You will get Hellscream's Burden debuff which causes a 20% slow.

All you need to do now is avoid taking any damage from Torment by standing in the safe zones during Torment and Tormented Eruptions.

You can see which zone is safe by looking opposite the boss and moving the the area where torment isn't forming (someone should call this out).

The major challenge is during Tormented Eruptions because you will need to move 5 times total.

Any individual or group movement buffs such as Stampeding Roar will greatly help during this time.
