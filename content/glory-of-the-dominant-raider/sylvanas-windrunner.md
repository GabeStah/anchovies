## Details

For this achievement you will want to collect the four Prismas around phase 2 of the Sylvannas encounter. There will be one Prisma for each covenant. These Prismas will spawn on fixed spots through the phase 2.

- 1 Prisma is right behind you where you spawn.
- 2nd Prisma is on the furthest back on the 3rd chain-platform
- 3rd Prisma is on the left end of the 4th chain-platform (and can be seen when you start in phase 2)
- 4th Prisma is on the 5th chain-platform in the far end (run strait and go to the left).

While the Prismas’ spawn location is fixed, the order of them is random. It is important to remember the order of how the Prisma spawn as this will trigger the final effect of the achievement in phase 3.

After collecting all 4 Prismas and entering Phase 3. All players will start on the “maldraxxus” platform which can be seen as there is a large Maldraxxus symbol on the platform. If you run clockwise the platforms are (when starting at the Maldraxxus platform):

Maldraxxus – Venture – Kyrian – Night Fae.
Through phase 3, Anduin is fighting Jaina, Bolvard and Thrall on the middle platform. During these fight Auduin will at times cast Blasphemy

. By having each Prisma carrier standing on their platform (Maldraxxus Prism on the Maldraxxus symbol etc.) the focusing Prisma will be activated.

However, the players with the Prismas must enter the symbols in the same order as the orbs spawn, els they will interrupt each other.
So pick up the Prisma. Have each player jump over to the platform representing their Prisma and go on top off the symbols in the same order as the Prismas are found before Anduin finishes his cast on:

---

Do phase 1 as normal as the prism collection takes place during intermission.

Please note: the location of each prism is fixed, but the order they appear in is random

The first prism is behind where you spawn. You do NOT need to be a member of the covenant to collect the prism.

You can catch a glimpse of the third prism before leaving the first chain.

The second prism is on the third chain, at the far end. Grab this after the Sylvanas burn.

The third prism is on the fourth chain on side furthest from the bridge.

The fourth prism is and the end of the 5th chain, on the far side.

Once in the final phase, each prism carrier needs to go to their respective platforms and stand on their symbol.

In case you forgot:
Maldraxxus (Necrolord) is green
Ardenweald (Night Fae) is Dark Blue
Bastion (Kyrian) is Light Blue
Revendreth (Venthyr) is Red

After activating the focusing prism, complete the fight as normal.
