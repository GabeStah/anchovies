## Details

> **PET BIGGLESWORTH AFTER THE FIGHT**

Can be soloed by tank or Oddly Intangible Key anima power holder.

Before you pull two or more players must get the Oddly Intangible Key anima power. During Hungering Mist Buttons and Moriaz will spawn out in the unsafe areas. They spawn on opposite sides of the room in four static positions. Like a clock 12, 3, 6, and 9.

Buttons is interactable, you will see a cogwell on it. Use the players with Oddly Intangible Key check these four spawn points. Inorder to get Name A Better Duo, I'll Wait you must pick up Buttons and have that player get to Moriaz the Red before Hungering Mist cast ends.

Recommend high mobility classes, or a priest grip to make it easier.

It doesn't seem like you actually need Oddly Intangible Key power for achievement. It just helps survive the cast. A fast tank can just use a defensive during intermission and still interact with Moriaz the Red and Buttons. Or a fast class with immunities like a DH or Rogue
