## Details

> **PET BIGGLESWORTH AFTER THE FIGHT** Before Soulrender/Painsmith/Remnant.

To the Nines is one of the easier achievements in the meta. You must DPS Kyra and Signe to 10% health, this will summon Skyja to the encounter. Skyja will periodically mark three players with Fragments of Destiny. Do not dispell them, have them goto the center of the room with a healer. After three cast you should have nine total Fragments of Destiny buffs on the raid.

You must carefully dispell the each player with Fragments of Destiny to get all nine on the same person. When dispelled they jump to the closest person. Once all nine are on the same person dispell them and they will coalesce into a Shard of Destiny. Then you just kill the boss.

DPS Kyra and Signe to 10% health to summon Skyja and start the next phase.

Skyja will periodically mark people with a Fragments of Destiny debuff.

Stack everyone with a Fragments of Destiny to one spot in the room (use a marker).

Note: When a Fragments of Destiny is dispelled it will jump to the closest person.

Dispel everyone to get all nine fragments onto one person.

Once 9 fragments are on one person, dispel them so it forms a Fragments of Destiny

After that, you can kill the boss
