_{{ requirement }}_

> - Boss: {{ data.boss }}
> - Difficulty: **<span style="{{ difficulty.easy.style }}">{{ difficulty.easy.name }}</span>**
> - Video: [YouTube]({{ video }})

## Details

- Six {{ data.add }} are invisible around the room.
- The {{ data.add }}s can be spotted by see-invisible effects.
- Landing a {{ data.descent }} on a {{ data.add }} kills it.
- Once all six {{ data.add }} are killed, the achievement is white.

## Preparation

Raid-mark all six Poop Pile locations, which indicate where a {{ data.add }} is standing.

## Strategy

1. Engage {{ data.boss }} and move toward a handful of marked {{ data.add }} locations.
2. Players targeted by {{ data.echolocation }} should split up and individually stand on a marked location.
3. Once {{ data.descent }} is cast the {{ data.add }} at that location is killed.
4. Move the boss/raid toward new locations and drop {{ data.descent }}s until the achievement is white.
5. Kill {{ data.boss }} as normal.
