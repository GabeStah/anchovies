## Details

- During the fight, summoning a {{ data.pet }} pet causes it to gain energy slowly.
- After ~4 minutes the {{ data.pet }} reaches full energy and transforms into the {{ data.dark_animus }} boss from Throne of Thunder.
- {{ data.dark_animus }} must be defeated to turn the achievement white.

## Preparation

- Assign **JUST ONE** person to have their {{ data.pet }} summoned, to prevent multiple {{ data.dark_animus }} spawns.
- Everyone else should desummon their battle pets.

## Strategy

1. Engage {{ data.boss }} and DPS as normal.
2. Stop all {{ data.boss }} damage at ~30% HP.
3. Confirm that the {{ data.pet }} is slowly gaining energy.
4. Once {{ data.dark_animus }} spawns, Bloodlust and burn it down.
5. Confirm achievement is white then kill {{ data.boss }} as normal.
