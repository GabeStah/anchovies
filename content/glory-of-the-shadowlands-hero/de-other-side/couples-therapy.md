## Details

During each phase the normal mechanics target random party members with arrow markers, indicating they should run next to the active boss to properly handle the effects.

## Strategy

1. Do the fight as normal.
2. For Millhouse, the (2) targeted players stands on either side of the boss so he is hit by the Laser from Millificent.
3. For Millificent, the (1) targeted player stands within 10 yards of the boss so she is hit by the Shadowfury from Millhouse.

> If your group DPS is especially high, be careful not to initially push Millhouse to 10%, as doing so may prevent you from being unable to deal with Millificent's abilities.

## Zone Achievements Order

No strategy changes are required to complete this achievement while also doing [Highly Communicable](highly-communicable ':relative'). Doing the fight properly automatically awards {{ title }}.
