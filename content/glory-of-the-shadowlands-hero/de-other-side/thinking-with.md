> - Zone: {{ zone }}

## Details

- During the {{ data.boss }} encounter `5` Orbs will spawn floating about 20 yards above the platform.
- Stepping into a {{ data.trap }} knocks the player high enough in the air to reach an Orb.
- Horizontal movement is disabled while traveling vertically from a {{ data.trap }} explosion.
  - To collect an Orb, preemptively stand directly underneath the Orb location and wait for a {{ data.trap }} to spawn at your location, then wait to be knocked in the air.

## Preparation

Zoom your camera out as far as is comfortable and angle the view so it looks directly down upon the top of your character.

## Strategy

1. Engage {{ data.boss }}.
2. Everyone in the party should immediately find the nearest Orb in the air and stand directly underneath it.
3. Since {{ data.trap }} always spawns at the feet of all `5` party members, if everyone is standing underneath a unique Orb it is possible to collect all `5` Orbs in one round.
4. If needed, repeat steps 2-3 until all `5` Orbs are collected.
5. Kill {{ data.boss }} as normal.

## Zone Achievements Order

If you're completing [Highly Communicable](highly-communicable ':relative') at the same time as this achievement, consider assigning only `1` Orb collector person to be knocked in the air and touch Orbs. This player _should not_ be worrying about [Corrupted Blood](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=322746/corrupted-blood).

> Assign someone who can easily survive the [Explosive Contrivance](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=320230/explosive-contrivance) damage.
