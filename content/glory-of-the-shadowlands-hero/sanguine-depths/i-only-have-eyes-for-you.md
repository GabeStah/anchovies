# {{ title }}

_{{ requirement }}_

> - Boss: {{ data.boss }}
> - Difficulty: **<span style="{{ difficulty.easy.style }}">{{ difficulty.easy.name }}</span>**
> - Type: **{{ type }}**
> - Zone: {{ zone }}

## Zone Achievements Order

If you're doing all the {{ zone }} achievements in one run then **DO NOT** start {{ title }} until both [Residue Evil](residue-evil ':relative') and [Kaal-ed Shot](kaaled-shot ':relative') have been completed/attempted that run. The ideal order is:

- [Residue Evil](residue-evil ':relative')
- [Kaal-ed Shot](kaaled-shot ':relative')
- {{ title }}

## Details

- {{ data.boss }} is a stationary unattackable statue standing in the second optional room across from the bridge leading to the circular jail cell area.

- Collecting both the {{ data.left }} and {{ data.right }} and placing them in the {{ data.boss }} statue activates it, agroing it and forcing you to fight it.
- The {{ data.left }} is in the room next to {{ data.boss }}, as seen above.
- The {{ data.right }} is in a coffin in the final trash room just before [General Kaal](https://www.wowhead.com/npc=165318/general-kaal).

!> Each gem has a 10-minute duration, after which time they'll disappear and cannot be recovered. **DO NOT** pick them up until the entire zone between [General Kaal](https://www.wowhead.com/npc=165318/general-kaal) and {{ data.boss }} is cleared.

## Strategy

1. Clear the zone as normal, all the way through [General Kaal](https://www.wowhead.com/npc=165318/general-kaal).
2. Have one player pick up the {{ data.right }} from the coffin outside.
3. The entire group should make their way back up the dungeon to the far room with the {{ data.left }}.
4. Place both gems in {{ data.boss }} and prepare to fight.
5. Kill {{ data.boss }}.

!> Do not take {{ data.boss }} for granted. He is easy but has a few abilities that deal A LOT of damage if not avoided, particularly his beam attack. Use cooldowns and movement abilities.
